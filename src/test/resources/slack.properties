# The slack connector allows you to annotate your scenarios with a reference to channels
# in slack, for example @slack[#mychannel]. You can specify more than one channel
# separated by commas @slack[#channel1,#channel2,#channel3]. It must be only channels (#),
# not users (@)
#
# This will send a notification to the specified channels in case the scenario fails.
# You must create a file like this one under src/test/resources/slack.properties.
#
# All variables can also be set with maven variables (i.e -Dslack.token=abcdefg123456)
# in case you would like to obfuscate them for privacy reasons

# Authentication token bearing required scopes. Required
slack.token=abcdefg123456

# Emoji to use as the icon for this message. Defaults to :ko: if not specified
slack.iconEmoji=:ko:

# Set your bot's user name. Defaults to 'Test report bot' if not specified
slack.username=Test report bot
