@web
Feature: Steps for testing web pages

  This feature provides examples on how to use some of the most common steps for selenium. This steps are also
  used for testing GingerSpec and make sure all steps work before every release.

  The steps make use of a local version of https://testpages.herokuapp.com, a public and free set of test pages
  for automating or testing. If you would like to run this tests, you can substitute http://${DEMO_SITE_HOST} by
  https://testpages.herokuapp.com.

  All scenarios that include steps for testing web pages using selenium (such as this one) must include the "@web"
  annotation. This is necessary, since it signals GingerSpec that it should bootstrap selenium and other important
  components.
