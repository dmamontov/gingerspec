# The Jira connector allows you to annotate your scenarios with a reference to an entity
# in Jira, for example @jira[QMS-123]
#
# This will allow you to control the execution of scenarios based on the status
# of the linked entity in Jira as well as to update the status of the entity
# in Jira if the Scenario fails. You must create a file like this one under
# src/test/resources/jira.properties
#
# All variables can also be set with maven variables (i.e -Djira.personal.access.token=abcdefg123456)
# in case you would like to obfuscate them for privacy reasons

# Base URL of the Jira server
jira.server.url=https://my.jira.server

# Personal authentication token
jira.personal.access.token=abcdefg123456

# Will run the scenario only if the linked Jira entity is in one of the given statuses (if not specified, defaults to 'DONE,DEPLOYED'. Case insensitive)
jira.valid.runnable.statuses=DONE,DEPLOYED

# Change linked Jira entity status if scenario fails (if not specified, defaults to 'true')
jira.transition.if.fail=true

# If jira.transition.if.fail=true, the linked Jira entity will transition to this status (if not specified, defaults to 'TO REVIEW'. Case insensitive)
jira.transition.if.fail.status=TO REVIEW
