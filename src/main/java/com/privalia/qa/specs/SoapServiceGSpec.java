    /**
     * Executes remote webservice method with parameters
     * <p>
     * Executes the remote method in the webservice. A request body must be provided for this operation. There is also the possibility
     * of altering values of the request body before sending providing a datatable. Since the library is capable of using any webservice,
     * it does not know in advance the format of the XML messages that are interchanged between the server and the clients. This is why
     * is necessary to provide the XML request that should be sent when executing a particular method.
     * <p>
     * Following the example of the webservice located at http://www.dneonline.com/calculator.asmx, the webservice exposes
     * 4 methods: Add, Divide, Multiply and Subtract. To execute the "Add" method, the following XML message should be sent to the server:
     * <pre>
     * {@code
     * <soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
     *    <soap:Body>
     *       <Add xmlns="http://tempuri.org/">
     *          <intA>int</intA>
     *          <intB>int</intB>
     *       </Add>
     *    </soap:Body>
     * </soap:Envelope>
     * }
     * </pre>
     * Notice how the XML format of the request contains the variables intA and intB. The server will read this variables from the request,
     * perform an "Add" and return a result in XML format. The information regarding the format of the XML requests and responses is usually
     * well documented and readily available for consumers. If this is not the case, you should contact the webservice developers for this information
     * <p>
     * This request XML message format should be stored in a separate file (for this example, lets save it to schemas/AddRequest.xml)
     * To execute the "Add" method with intA = 1 and intB = 1:
     * <pre>
     * {@code
     *      Given The webservice WSDL is located in 'http://www.dneonline.com/calculator.asmx?WSDL'
     *      When I execute the method 'Add' based on 'schemas/AddRequest.xml' with:
     *          | intA | 1 |
     *          | intB | 1 |
     * }
     * </pre>
     * You can provide a datatable containing a set of modifications to be performed on the XML request before it is sent to the server
     * (this is necessary in this particular case). If this is not required, you can use the same step without the datatable:
     * <pre>
     * {@code
     *      When I execute the method 'Add' based on 'schemas/AddRequest.xml'
     * }
     * </pre>
     *
     * @see #setRemoteWSDL(String)
     * @param actionName        Remote method to execute. The method name will be translated to the corresponding SOAPAction
     * @param requestFile       File containing the request (XML)
     * @param foo               parameter generated by cucumber because of the optional expression
     * @param modifications     (Optional) a datatable with modifications to perform on the request before sending
     *                          Example:
     *                          Assuming the request XML body contains the following tags:
     *                          {@code      <intA>int<intA/>
     *                                      <intB>int<intB/> }
     *                          To alter the value of intA and intB, a datatable like the following should be provided:
     *                          {@code      | intA  | 1 |
     *                                      | intB  | 1 | }
     *                          And the corresponding values for the given tags in the body will be
     *                          {@code      <intA>1<intA/>
     *                                      <intB>1<intB/> }
